I will need to create a basic password generator site with a 'Generate Password' button using HTML and CSS.

Once user clicks the button, a PROMPT BOX will ask how many characters the pw should contain. 
    <!-- what happens if anything other than a number is input? 
    what happens if you press cancel? 
    what happens if you input anything less than 8 characthers? -->

Once user types in a number ABOVE 8 and less than 128, a CONFIRM BOX will ask to click OK to confirm including special characthers.
<!-- OK = special characters
CANCEL = no special characters -->

Once user confirms OK or CANCEL, another CONFIRM BOX will ask to confirm if you want to include numberic characters.
<!-- OK = numeric characters
CANCEL = no numeric characters -->

Once user confirms OK or CANCEL, another CONFIRM BOX will ask to confirm if you want to include lowercase characters.
<!-- OK = lowercase characters
CANCEL = no lowercase characters -->

Once user confirms OK or CANCEL, another CONFIRM BOX will ask to confirm if you want to include uppercase characters.
<!-- OK = uppercase characters
CANCEL = no uppercase characters -->

Finally a password will be generated in a DASHED TEXT BOX with the selected requirements.

<!-- lots of variables -->
<!-- more functions  -->
